The ESP32 is such a versatile and popular platform that we put together this basic kit with OLED display, 5V and 3.3V regulators and a prototyping area with all the pins numbered. This kit is supplied in component form and requires soldering, makes a great weekend project. The onboard prototyping area is exactly wired like a Breadboard.

Header J1 is a direct expansion of ESP32 and shares only GND, SCL and SDA with J2, J3, J4 and J5
